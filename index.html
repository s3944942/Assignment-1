  <h2><center>Basic info about me</center></h2>
  <h3>Name:</h3> <p>Daniel Gell</p>
  <h3>Student Number:</h3>
  <p>s3944942</p>
  <h3>Student Email:</h3>
  <p>s3944942@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
  <h3>A picture of me (how handsome!):</h3>
  <img src="student ID photo 2.jpg" style="width:250px;height:auto;">
  <h3>Basic info:</h3>
  <p>I was born in Australia and have lived here my whole life, I lived in Melbourne until I was 7, where I moved to the small Gippsland town of Rosedale, and then moved back to Melbourne when I was 18, this time leaving the parents behind. I graduated high school from Sale College in 2021 with a (slightly below) average ATAR, and I only speak English.</p>
  <h3>Interesting fact:</h3>
  <p>I am a musician, I’ve been playing the guitar for almost a decade and currently or have previously played: bass, drums, piano, saxophone, banjo, and ukulele. I also make and release music under the name of <a href="https://springthingmusic.bandcamp.com/">Spring Thing</a> in my spare time (when I’m not studying, of course) and have had the opportunity to play shows alongside the likes of Thelma Plum and 2021 finalist of The Voice Australia, Mick Harrington. Alongside being a performer of music, I am also an avid music listener and collector, since 2013 I have been collecting CDs, vinyl records, and cassette tapes, amassing about 200, 100, and 10 of each one respectively, with my taste ranging from Sunn O))) to Carly Rae Jepsen.</p>

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <h3>What is my interest? Where did it start?</h3>
  <p>Ever since I was a young boy I’ve been interested in computers, I’ve just been fascinated by learning how to do things on them and making them do what I want them to do and the satisfaction gained by doing so. Even back in primary school I was the “computer kid”, helping tech illiterate teachers and staff with their computer issues. Then going through to high school I always excelled in studies relating to IT, even completing Year 12 Information Technology in year 11, while also getting the second highest score in the entire class… of two people. Someone who really inspired me to pick this career path was my teacher for that year, Mr. Donald Watson. He really showed the class not just how to pass the course, but the ways these skills can be used in the outside world be and the skills that are in demand, like web design and data analysis. Also in that class I was introduced to databases and the managing of data, something about the act of sorting a large amount of data and then analysing it to make conclusions is just really satisfying and rewarding to me. In terms of actual real world experience with IT, I don’t have much, to be frank I’m going into this course very empty handed, I’m not even entirely sure if I want to do IT as a career, I’m not entirely sure what I want to do as a career at all. I might go into trade school after this degree, I might continue my work as a barista, I might get a cozy job managing a database at home and making absolute bank from it. The only work I’ve done in IT is the occasional data entry for my mother’s bookkeeping business.</p>
  <h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
  <p>To be honest, the main reason I chose RMIT was because Swinburne stopped offering the major I wanted to do for their Bachelor of ICT course, and this was my second choice. But even with that being said there are other reasons I had RMIT as my second choice, one reason is that both of my parents went here, my mother did a Bachelor of Business Information Systems and my dad did a degree in plumbing, not sure which one, but both in the 1980s (and if you were curious, no they did not meet here, they weren’t even at the university at the same time for that matter). I also like this university’s location, I’d always known I was going to move back to Melbourne for university and beyond, so why not go to the university that’s in the middle of the actual city. It’s also probably the easiest university to get to via public transport, which for someone who cannot drive is always a bonus.</p>
  <h3>What do I expect to learn here?</h3>
  <p>In terms of what I expect to learn, I’m not entirely sure, I’m hoping to learn about something new to me completely and decide that it’s what I wanna do in life. Even if I don’t end up using IT as a part of my career in the future, I still hope that this course will teach me further about tech literacy and ideas that I can end up using later in life for my own personal projects. I’m also looking forwards to learning about website design, in this very assignment, I’m even thinking about getting a diploma in it later to further hone my skills after this course so I can make money in the world of IT while also expressing my creative side.</p>

  <img src="job screenshot 3.jpg" style="width:500px;height:auto;">
  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>This job is for administrating the database for 9X5 Consulting, a business consulting company based in Melbourne. This position entails managing the organisation’s data and ensuring the security of their files. The job also seems to be just general IT support, so perhaps I would have to help Debbie in marketing figure out why her emails aren’t sending (she forgot that she unplugged the Ethernet cable). This position is appealing to me because judging by the scope, I can only assume it pays really well, I also enjoy working with data and data systems. Not to mention working from home is a huge benefit.</p>
  <h3>Job Requirements:</h3>
  <p>The application calls for people that are highly trained in SQL and other systems for managing data, presumably someone who has done this sort of thing before (for over 5 years to be exact) and knows their way around a file server and the cloud. Also someone who has the ability to manage a team and communicate efficiently with people.</p>
  <h3>Job Requirements that I meet:</h3>
  <p>To be frank, none of them. I have base level knowledge on a couple of things in the job listing like SQL, but I don’t know how to use any of the software that this job listing says. But that’s alright, I’m learning, and maybe someday with enough training and working below people as a mere database managing assistant, I can work up in a company, and if this job pays better I’ll scoop it up.</p>
  <h3>The Plan:</h3>
  <p>The first step of my plan is to graduate RMIT University with a Bachelor of Information Technology, so far, so good. Then to get a job at a place like a school or smaller institution to help with their basic computing needs. Then one day I hear that the organisation is having trouble managing their data that they keep in a filing cabinet behind reception, so what else can I do other than offer my services to them to help create a database to store this data in. All of a sudden I’m top dog around these parts of town, everyone is fawning over how easy it is to work, then I’m asked to do more things, and as I work out how to do these, I’m learning more and more about how to use things like Windows Server 2012, Azure, and Jira. At this point I’m already doing the work of a database administrator but just without the pay, so I go to my boss to ask if I could get a raise, he sits back in his chair and says nothing, just looks at me smugly with a smug and cheeky smile on his face, frustrated and confused I ask him again, he pulls out a box of cigars and lights one up, standing up and walking me over to the window, he tells me a quip about his life or something like that, yet my question about the raise is still unanswered. After listening to him for what seems like hours the truth comes out, I’m not getting a raise, I slam my gun and badge on the table and storm out, commenting on how I’m never going to work for the force again, and before he even has a chance to question why I have a gun and badge for a job at an accounting firm I’m out the door, spending many long nights drinking away my sorrows in dark smoky bars until the pain goes away. One night as I’m halfway through my whisky I recognise a face through the smoke, it’s my old boss, he sees me and I see him, our eyes meet with a sense of mutual hatred yet respect for eachother’s work. We start talking and he mentions how the office hasn’t been the same since I left, he offers me my old job back but I refuse, I look him in the eyes with my slightly teary expression and blurt out “Don’t you get it old man? I’ve wanted to be a database administrator ever since I was in university and you’re gonna give me my old job back with no benefits? Go fuck yourself!”, after what felt like an eternity he gives me that same look he gave me from the day I quit, a smug cheeky smile. “What is it?” I question, “Daniel, I’m not offering your old job back, we need you as a database administrator”, he responds, sliding my gun and badge back to me along the graffiti-riddled bar table. A week passes and all is good, I’m living my dream life, administrating databases and I couldn’t be happier.</p>

  <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
  <h3>Myers-Briggs test - ENTP-T</h3>
  <h4>What does this mean for me?</h4>
  <p>I disagree, I wouldn’t call myself an extrovert, I do extroverted things, I like being the centre of attention and around people I’m close with I can be very loud, but most of the time, I rarely reach out to people, and enjoy the comfort of my own company.</p>
  <h4>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
  <p>If I had to assess what this meant for my part in group activities I suppose I would say that it makes sense for me to be told what to do, just do the tasks I’ve been assigned by other group members.</p>
  <h4>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
  <p>When forming groups I should look for ones with strong leaders and people who can provide more of an emotional point of view towards topics to contrast with my thinking nature.</p>
  <h3>Learning style test. - Auditory/Tactile Learner</h3>
  <h4>What does this mean for me?</h4>
  <p>I’m not sure if I’d agree with the auditory part, I rarely remember if people just tell me something with no visuals or actions, I still don’t know the names of anyone in our class. One of the questions asked that skewed my results was along the lines of “What would you rather do with friends?” and one of them was “go to a concert”, I disagree that liking music makes me an auditory learner, but whatever they say I guess.</p>
  <h4>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
  <p>When working in groups I should be able to handle getting tasks demonstrated to me and doing them, while people who are better visual learners can focus on being shown how to do certain things.</p>
  <h4>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
  <p>When working in groups I should play to my strengths and focus on getting my hands dirty with the material, while other people in the group can work out the nitty gritty finer details on how the correct way to do things are.</p>
  <h3>Creativity Test – 66.43% creative</h3>
  <h4>What does this mean for me?</h4>
  <p>This is apparently above average (62.86%), and that doesn’t surprise me, my main hobby literally requires me to be creative above all else so I sure hope my score for it is better than the average person’s.</p>
  <h4>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
  <p>When behaving in a team I should be better at brainstorming and coming up with ideas than most other people to allow for my full potential as an above average creative soul to come through.</p>
  <h4>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
  <p>When forming a team I should look for people that are more rational and see things more black and white to contrast my ideas to come up with more varied solutions to problems.</p>
  <h3>BONUS: What "Friends" character am I? - Rachel</h3>
  <h4>What does this mean for me?</h4>
  <p>This means nothing to me, I have never seen Friends.</p>
  <h4>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
  <p>Maybe I should be more Friendly in group settings because the show is called Friends?</p>
  <h4>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
  <p>I guess I should be around other Rachels? Or maybe no Rachels…</p>

  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  <h3>Overview:</h3>
  <p>My idea for a project is one that I’ve already had lingering in my mind for some time, it’s something that fascinates me due to its subject matter and also its use of IT. My idea is to have a highly searchable and customisable database of the individual performer, production, and songwriting credits for songs. I plan on calling this the DISC (Database of Individual Song Credits), no I did not pick this just for the name… maybe a little bit. This will allow the user to take really deep dives into an artists performing discography to find out the nitty gritty about who played what where and for who.</p>
  <h3>Motivation:</h3>
  <p>I am a music nerd, I’ll admit it, and I’ve always loved listening to an album and reading the liner notes on who plays what instruments on each of the songs, allows me to further appreciate the musicianship on some of my favourite albums. I also happen to know there are many other people that like doing the same in music circles, especially in the circles for music genres like jazz, where individual performers and soloists gain legendary status. However, with the rise of streaming, the sales of physical media have gone down significantly, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), sales for physical media are the lowest ever since they started counting in the 1970s, and thus making it harder to find out who is playing on recordings without doing some digging, while Spotify and YouTube are rolling out features to help identify performers, it’s still hard to do specific searches on what else these musicians have played on.</p>
  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>The way my project would work is by having a website that users can interact with the database on. The homepage would give the user options on what they which to search by having a drop-down box allowing them to search for Artist, Performer, Songwriter, Album, Song. After the user has searched for an Artist for example, if they haven’t clicked on an option from the auto-complete, then they will be presented with a page with a list of artists with similar names. Once an artist has been selected, the user will be greeted with a photo of the artist, a brief summary of the band (to help differentiate bands with the same or similar names), and a list of albums by default, or if the user desires they can switch to another panel of the artist’s songs. If the user chooses an album then they will be presented with a track list of the album and given the option to have a quick overview of the song credits under each song, with the option to click on any given song title to go to a dedicated page for the song. On said page there will be a list of the performers, songwriters and production team for any given song, from there you can click on any of the performers’ names and be taken to a page where the user can either view the full list of albums they’ve performed on in chronological or reverse chronological order, or use the search functions to narrow down that list, by instrument, production role, songwriting and year, as well as viewing stats like who the most common collaborator is, and when the artist was born/died, when they had the most contributions and what their most common contribution type was. The search tools for a performer will provide a drop-down list of artists they’ve played on songs of, where the user can select one, as well as a drop-down list of instruments, and a multi-slider to select the year range. There will also be advanced options, like choosing other performers to combine with, to see what songs both performers have played on.</p>
  <h3>Tools and Technologies:</h3>
  <p>For this project, I will need a relational database management system, such as to store all the data and relay the information from queries that the user makes, I will likely use PostgreSQL or SQLite, just depends on which one I prefer using. Not to mention I will need a server to host this data for the user to connect to, which will likely be done over AWS. I will also need the actual data of the song credits, which I’m considering gathering in a few ways, the most time consuming of which is manually typing out the information into a spreadsheet and then importing into the database. This method would be the easiest, I don’t have to worry about scraping a website like Wikipedia, where the formatting for albums credits is very varied. Another option would be scraping a site like MusicBrainz, which does have all the information sorted in a specific way, yet is missing a lot more than Wikipedia. I will probably do the former.</p>
  <h3>Skills Required:</h3>
  <p>To achieve this project, I will need to further learn how to program HTML, as my current skills are very basic and lacking in finesse, not to mention I will have to learn how to use SQL and work within that. I will also need to learn more about website design, as a lot of the music database type websites out there have a really aged appearance, and I would like my website to be different by looking modern and very accessible.</p>
  <h3>Outcome:</h3>
  <p>The outcome of my project is allowing the everyday person or intense music nerd to look up and compare information on the performances on their favourite songs and albums. This also benefits the artists by giving them more recognition and exposure towards work they’ve done that would’ve been relegated to the depths of the CD booklet. My project would also allow for people to find new music by searching the songs that have been written by a certain songwriter, and using that list to find other songs written by that person that they might not have heard before.</p>
